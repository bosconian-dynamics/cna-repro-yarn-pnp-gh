Issue reproduction repo regarding the inability to push a git repository created with yarn create next-app on WSL to GitHub due to Yarn PnP configuration and GitHub size limitations.

This is just a dummy placeholder to satisfy [vercel/next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)'s issue template requirement. **It is not possible to provide a minimal reproduction repository for this issue as the issue at hand is itself the inability to push a fresh CNA project to GitHub.**
